# lib12d
A library of commonly-used functions for use in the 12d Programming Language (12dPL). 

To quote the official 12d documentation:
> The 12d Solutions Programming Language (12dPL), is a powerful programming language designed to run from within 12d Model. 
> Its main purpose is to allow users to enhance the existing 12d Model package by writing their own programs.
> 12dPL is based on a subset of the C++ language with special extensions to allow easy manipulation of 12d Model data.

The 12dPL already comes with many function calls for creating and manipulating objects within a 12d Model project. However, this library provides some further functions and helper routines to make writing and developing 12d Model apps in the 12dPL much easier for users.
